## About

Like <b><i><a href="#Home" title="Home">Home</a></i></b> says, <b>Goldfish Kingdom</b> is an <b><i>upcoming</i></b> series about all kinds of goldfish, meaning the series has not been exactly <b><i>released</i></b> yet. But you've still gotten early acess to <b><i>knowing it while you wait.</i></b><br><br>
<b>NOTE: "Goldfish Kingdom"</b> is a parody of the goldfish they show<i>(ed)></i> in those TV commericals back in the day, so please don't rant on it, OK?
